    1. What is React?
    Ans: React is the 'V' in the MVC(Model View Controller). It is not a SPA(Single Page Application) framework but a  view library.Here, your view is hierarchy of components. 

    2. What are the basic steps to follow to install React?
    Ans:  1. Before installing React, you need to install: 
    - node.js [link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/]

      "Note": 
      To check whether, it is installed properly or not: 
      Type in command line: npm --version  [it will display the version for you if it is correctly installed]

      2.Next Step is to choose "Editor": 
      There are plenty of them out there (Sublime, Atom, VS Code,etc.) 
      I personally prefer: Visual Studio Code [link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download]

      3. Finally, In Your Editor or command line: 
      create a folder: md folder-name  [E.g. md my-react-app]
      switch to the path: cd folder-name [E.g. cd my-react-app] 
      Now, install required libraries: npm install -g react react-dom  [react and react-dom are two required libraries to install]
      Then, create your first React app: create-react-app your-app-name [E.g. create-react-app my-react-app]
      Last but not least: npm --init [It will intiliaze your package.json file]

      You are ready to go!
      To start type: npm start  [It will run local server]

      "Note": 
      These are basic configurations required to install React. 
      Later, you can add more libraries and change configurations depending on your application need. 

      It is better to install zero configuration setup globally. 
      Type in your command line: npm install -g create-react-app   
      You can check the version as: create-react-app --version 

    3. What is JSX? 
    Ans: JSX is the syntax extension to Javascript. It looks something like this: 
        const element = <h1> hello world </h1>; 

        It looks similar to HTML Tag but is something more...
        It combines the features of Javascript with HTML Tag. 

        So, you can do something like this: 
        <div> {element} </div>   
        The above statement is equivalent to: 
        <div> <h1> hello world </h1> </div> 

        Note: We will explore something more very soon...

    4. Why use 'const' and 'let' over 'var'?
    Ans: Generally, 'var' is used to decalare the variable. But due to its side effects! it is being replaced by 'let and 'const'. 
        When to use 'let': 
        Use 'let' whenever you know your value will change. 

        When to use 'const': 
        Use 'const' whenever you know your value will not change.

        For example: 
        let value = 5; 
        value = 6 ; //here, the value is changed. 
        value = "i am not a string"; //not allowed
        
        const greet = "hello"; 
        greet = "Good Morning";  //not allowed 
        But be careful, when you use 'let' and 'const' to declare variables. 
        We will explore more about 'let' and 'const' very soon...


    5. How to render the list of items in React?
    Ans: To render the list of items in React, you can use "map" function. 
        Example: 
            const personList  = [ {name: Bharat, Id: 1}, 
                {name: Zenius, Id: 2}, 
                {name: Rhoduens, Id: 3}, 
           ];  
        
           <ul> {personList.map( item =>  <li key = {item.Id} > {item.name}</li>  }</ul> 
           
           Do you see we use keyword "key"? It is used to distinguish between the item.
           Later, it (i.e. key) can be used to delete and update operation. 
           
           Caution!:
           Never use index as key to distinguish the item. If you use index as key, whenever the order of the object changes, 
           the key will change. So, it will make difficult to reference the item in delete and update operation. 
           
           Example: 
           //do not use index as key 
            <ul> {personList.map( (item, key) =>  <li key = {key} > {item.name}</li>  }</ul>
            
    6. Do you know about Arrow functions? 
    Ans: Arrow functions are short hand notation for function expressions in Javascript. 
        Js ES6 introduced Arrow functions. 
        Example:
        function() { //do something }  is equivalent to   () =>  { //do something  } 
        
        function add(a,b) {     
            return a + b; 
        }  
        
        add(4,5);   //9
        
        is equivalent to 
        
        const add = (a , b) => a + b; 
        add(4,5);  //9
