1. What is React?
Ans: React is the 'V' in the MVC(Model View Controller). It is not a SPA(Single Page Application) framework but a  view library. 
     Here, your view is hierarchy of components. 

2. What are the basic steps to follow to install React?
Ans:  1. Before installing React, you need to install: 
     - node.js [link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/]
     
    "Note": 
    To check whether, it is installed properly or not: 
    Type in command line: npm -v  [it will display the version for you if it is correctly installed]
    
   2.Next Step is to choose "Editor": 
    There are plenty of them out there (Sublime, Atom, VS Code,etc.) 
    I personally prefer: Visual Studio Code [link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download]
    
    3. Finally, In Your Editor or command line: 
       create a folder: md folder-name  [E.g. md my-react-app]
       switch to the path: cd folder-name [E.g. cd my-react-app] 
       Now, install required libraries: npm install -g react react-dom  [react and react-dom are two required libraries to install]
       Then, create your first React app: create-react-app your-app-name [E.g. create-react-app my-react-app]
       Last but not least: npm --init [It will intiliaze your package.json file]
       
       You are ready to go!
       To start type: npm start  [It will run local server]
       
       "Note": 
       These are basic configurations required to install React. 
       Later, you can add more libraries and change configurations depending on your application need. 
       
       It is better to install zero configuration setup globally. 
       Type in your command line: npm install -g create-react-app
