1. Can you tell something about "Destructuring" in Javascript ES6? 
Ans: The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties 
     from objects, into distinct variables.
     
     Example: 
     //ES6
     const username = { 
        firstName: 'zenius',
        lastName: 'lama'
     }; 
     const {firstName, lastName} = userName; 
     console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);  //zenius lama 
     
     In ES5, you had to do something like this: 
      const username = { 
        firstName: 'zenius',
        lastName: 'lama'
     }; 
     
     const firstName =  zenius.firstName; 
     const lastName = zenius.lastName; 
     console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);  //zenius lama
     
     Thus, it is elegant way of extracting the values from the array or properties from object into distinct variables.
